# Learning Log

Okay, so I haven't coded in Python in a reeeeeeally long time, so I did go back to AoC-2018 briefly in November to freshen up. I didn't end up doing much, but it helped to remind me that Java is really that much more verbose. 

Anyway, I hope to get through as many puzzles as possible and my goal is to learn something new with each one, especially from the part 2 solutions that tend to be less brute forceable.

## Day 1

I was on the road, so on one hand, I had plenty of free time on my hands, but on the other hand, I also had unreliable internet and an urge to complete asap in order to avoid motion sickness. 

I ended up writing the code for part 1 on my phone during lunch. I used to have to write a lot of print statements because I couldn't visualize very well what was happening without doing so, so getting it right on the first try without a way to test what I work felt really good, even if part 1 was super easy.

When we were visiting a temple earlier in the day, some of my relatives were discussing this neverending story that they were told as kids. My husband called it recursive storytelling and I replied, "Gah, I don't even remember how to write recursive functions anymore!" Well, speak of the devil. I went the looping route, but I will come back to this.

Also, really happy that I decided to separate out the fuel calculation in part 1 so that I didn't have to refactor anything in part 2.
